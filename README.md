## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- MongoDB (local or cloud instance)

### Installation

1. **Clone and install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm run install-all
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**:
   ```bash
   cp server/.env.example server/.env
   # Edit server/.env with your MongoDB URI and JWT secret
   ```

3. **Start the development servers**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This runs both the React frontend (port 3000) and Node.js backend (port 5000) concurrently.
